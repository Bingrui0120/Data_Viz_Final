## Executive Summary
Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor. In 2018, 570,000 women worldwide were still diagnosed with cervical cancer and 310,000 women died of cervical cancer. Since 2002, China has ranked first in the world in the number of deaths from cervical cancer.
Cervical cancer is currently the only malignant tumor with a clear cause and fully effective tertiary prevention methods. There are three key measures for cervical cancer prevention and treatment: vaccination, screening and treatment. WHO believes that by 2050, the successful implementation of these three measures can reduce more than 40% of new cases and 5 million related deaths.
HPV vaccination can effectively prevent the corresponding types of HPV infection and significantly reduce the risk of HPV infection-related diseases such as cervical cancer. Due to HPV vaccination and cancer screening, the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries has dropped significantly in the past two to three decades.
But in China, both HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening face many difficulties. Currently, the types of HPV vaccines on the Chinese market are limited, and most of the vaccines (3 of 4) are imported products. Therefore, HPV vaccines are expensive and the production capacity is small. Appointment HPV vaccines are always in short supply. In addition, many people also said that they did not know the HPV vaccine, and said that even if they are willing to receive the HPV vaccine, they have limited affordable price. However, the Chinese government previously stated that due to financial constraints, it currently does not consider including the HPV vaccine in its medical insurance policy.
In terms of cervical cancer screening, although the Chinese government has been promoting its free cervical and breast cancer screening program, the population covered by the program so far is very limited. In rural areas, women do not know much about cervical cancer, so they are not motivated to actively participate in screening. Even if they participate in cervical cancer screening, the accuracy of screening in rural medical institutions is low,
and screening efficiency is also poor, causing many cases of misdiagnosis or false positives. At the government level, cervical cancer screening has not received much attention. When the government faces the impact of other infectious diseases, the funds allocated for cervical cancer screening are often squeezed.
In this analysis, in order to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in China, I will analyze the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer screening separately. In the HPV vaccine section, we hope that local policies can expand the population of free HPV vaccines injections, especially vaccination in primary and secondary schools; at the same time, the government should also include vaccine manufacturers in the public health policy. Vaccine manufacturers, as stakeholders, can achieve a win-win situation in cooperation with the government. In addition, we also hope that all schools can strengthen education on HPV vaccines and cervical cancer starting from the compulsory education stage.
As for cervical cancer screening, we hope to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer screening through the training of laboratory physicians in the short term. In the long run, we hope to replace the Pap smear method with the acetic acid test (VIA) method to improve the efficiency and accessibility of cervical cancer screening. In addition, we hope that local governments can set up special funds for cervical cancer. In terms of publicity and education, each township government should use the community as a unit to conduct popular science on cervical cancer screening for local rural women at an appropriate time and post posters to strengthen the publicity of cervical cancer screening policies.

## Every year, a large number of women die of cervical cancer.

Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancies worldwide. In 2018, it ranked second in incidence and third in mortality worldwide, 570,000 women worldwide were still diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 310,000 women died of cervical cancer. About 85% of new cases and 90% of deaths occurred in underdeveloped areas (FIGO, 2018). In low- and middle-income countries, the incidence of cervical cancer is almost twice that of high-income countries, and the mortality rate is three times that of high-income countries.

In developed countries, due to the widespread use of Pap smear testing, the overall incidence of cervical cancer has been declining. However, in the past two decades, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China have been on the rise, especially among young women. Since 2002, China has ranked first in the world in the number of deaths from cervical cancer (Li, 2017). According to data from the National Cancer Center, a total of 75,500 people were newly diagnosed in China in 2016, and about 38,400 women died of cervical cancer. According to the China Health Statistics Yearbook, the mortality rate of women from cervical cancer increases with age. Among them, women aged 30-49 in urban areas and women aged 30-59 in rural areas accounted for the highest proportion of deaths from malignant tumors in women of the same age group.

The chart below shows the number of deaths from cervical cancer in all countries in the world in the past two decades. Among them, the blue line represents China, the orange line represents developed countries, and the gray line represents other countries. On the Dashboard, users can choose to view China, developed countries or other countries. Position the mouse on each line and Tableau will display the year, country and absolute value of the data.

The chart below shows the number of deaths due to cervical cancer per 100,000 in all countries in the world over the past two decades. It can be seen that although China's value is in the middle position compared with other countries in the world, the number of female died due to cervical cancer in recent years is still larger than that of developed countries. Most of the countries with higher numbers in the figure come from African countries. In Africa, most people are still in extreme poverty. Therefore, the average number of women giving birth to children is much higher than that of other countries in the world, and the proportion of households using contraceptive measures is also lower than other countries. A number of studies have confirmed that the use of contraceptive measures, the number of births, the age of first sexual intercourse, and the number of sexual partners are all related to cervical cancer. Therefore, it is normal that the incidence of cervical cancer in African countries is higher than that in developed countries and China.

China has invested a lot of money in recent years to solve extreme poverty. China's per capita GDP increases, and the people's living standards have continued to grow. In addition, the Chinese government initiated a free cervical and breast cancer screening program for women in 2008. However, the number of female deaths from cervical cancer in China has not declined, and even tends to increase year by year.

## Cervical cancer is a preventable cancer.

Almost 100% of cervical cancers are caused by infection with a high-risk type of human HPV. Cervical cancer is currently the only malignant tumor with a clear cause and fully effective tertiary prevention methods, according to the WHO. The two main methods to control the onset of cervical cancer are through HPV vaccine and screening for precancerous lesions (FIGO, 2018). Since the advent of the HPV vaccine in 2006, a total of 107 countries around the world have officially included the HPV vaccine in their national immunization plans (WHO, 2020). Because of HPV vaccination and cancer screening, the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries has dropped significantly in the past two to three decades. From 1975 to 2010, the incidence of cervical cancer in US female was reduced by half. From 2000 to 2015, the death toll from cervical cancer per 100,000 people also dropped from 2.8 to 2.3 per year (Curry, 2018).

The figure below compares the number of people who died of cervical cancer per 100,000 people in 1990 and 2015. It can be seen that in the past 15 years, the number of deaths from cervical cancer in developed countries has decreased. The United States fell from 3.96 to 2.98, and the United Kingdom fell from 6.44 to 3.06. However, China only dropped from 6.96 to 4.78, and its proportion is much higher than that of the United States in 1990. Therefore, the problem of cervical cancer in China brooks no delay.

### HPV Vaccine

The HPV vaccination still faces many problems in China. The current public acceptance of HPV vaccine is still low. In a questionnaire (Fu, 2018), by 2015, only 25% of respondents had heard of HPV preventive vaccines, and 14% knew that HPV vaccines could prevent cervical cancer and other diseases. Although WHO recommends that HPV vaccine be included in the immunization program, in September 2019, the National Medical Insurance Administration made it clear that non-therapeutic items such as tumor screening and cervical cancer vaccination will not be considered for inclusion in the basic medical insurance fund payment scope (NHC 5448, 2019). The medical security system has not been able to expand the scope of payment to non-treatment or preventive screening items. The HPV vaccines currently on the market in China are purchased by each vaccination site, usually priced according to market rules, and citizens voluntarily vaccinate at their own expense.

Currently, there are four types of cervical cancer vaccines on the Chinese market, namely, the quadrivalent and nine-valent vaccines produced by Merck, the bivalent vaccine produced by GSK, and the domestic bivalent vaccine developed by a Xiamen biological company. It is difficult to develop HPV vaccines with quadrivalent and nine-valent (Caixin, 2019). As a biological product, vaccines are highly uncertain and have high requirements for vaccine production, transportation and storage (Zhao, 2019), so China's HPV with the quadrivalent and nine-valent vaccines are imported and the price is relatively high. Such a low-yield and high-price situation is very detrimental to increasing the HPV vaccine injection rate.

### Cervical Cancer Screening
WHO also recommends that high coverage of 80% of people at risk of cervical cancer is an important factor in the successful screening program. Since 2009, China has begun to implement the "two cancers”(cervical cancer and breast cancer) free inspection project for rural women, and through central government funding, free cervical cancer and breast cancer inspections have been launched nationwide for rural women of the right age. In 2019, the National Health Commission and other 10 ministries and commissions jointly issued the "Healthy China Action-Cancer Prevention and Control Implementation Plan (2019-2022)", proposing that by 2022, the coverage of the "two cancers" screening counties for rural women will reach 80%. However, in 2015, the proportion of women aged 20-64 in China who had previously received cervical cancer screening was only 25.7% (of which 31.4% were screened for 35-64 years old), of which 30.0% in urban areas and 22.6% in rural areas (Xia, 2020).

After the start of the screening program, the scope of its pilot program has continued to expand, but population coverage has grown slowly. There are many reasons for this situation, including rural women taking care of the elderly and children and farmland at home, and no time to go to the county hospital to participate in the screening; meanwhile, many people go out to work, and because of household registration restrictions, there is no condition for them to participate in screening (Fu, 2018).

In most rural areas of China, 95% of cervical cancer screening methods are cytology (NHC, 2019). Although the cytological examination method can effectively reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, and is low in cost and easy to promote, it requires high professional quality for doctors (Fu, 2018). For hospitals that carry out cervical cancer screening, most of them are maternal and child health hospitals in rural counties and districts, there is a lack of qualified doctors. This has led to many incidents of missed and misdiagnosed cervical cancer screening.

In terms of cervical cancer screening, women in rural areas are not highly involved. As described in the previous article (Caixin, 2019), women in rural areas said that because they need to take care of the elderly and children or fields at home on weekdays, they rarely have time to go to the hospital for free cervical cancer screening on working days. At the same time, rural women do not have high awareness of cervical cancer screening, and they often go to the hospital for examination when they feel unwell, and do not have the consciousness of physical examination (Zhao, 2019). In summary, the subjective willingness of the target population to participate in the screening project is not positive, and the objective conditions of the time arrangement of the testing agency have restricted their ways of participating in the project. Therefore, women in rural areas have more resistance to participating in the cervical cancer screening project.

There are also some problems with medical testing institutions in rural areas that cover cervical cancer screening. The application of cytology screening has reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by 70% to 90% in developed countries (Zhang, 2015). At present, 95% of medical institutions in China use Papanicolaou (Pap) tests to detect cervical cancer (Fu, 2018). This method is operated by a gynecologist. The gynecologist removes a small amount of cell samples from the neck of the uterus, places them on a glass slide, and then let the cytopathologist observe whether the cell morphology is abnormal under the microscope. Although this method is easy to operate and low in cost, this method requires a high level of skill for the screening doctor (Qiao, 2008). Even for highly trained professionals, missed diagnosis still occurs. Its accuracy is affected by many factors, resulting in its low sensitivity, only 50% or even lower, and it is prone to a large number of false negative diagnosis results (Zhang, 2015). Currently in China, medical workers, especially doctors in cytopathology are very scarce (Wang, 2015). In the context of China's huge population base, it is almost impossible to screen women in rural areas for cervical cancer once every five years through cytological testing. Because the number of cervical cancer screenings is too large for institutions to cope with, some institutions will choose to outsource cell screening to third-party companies (Caixin, 2019). However, due to the difficulty of identifying the relevant responsible persons and the uneven quality of these outsourcing companies, misdiagnosis often occurs (Caixin, 2019).

Earlier in a meeting in 2019, Song Li, deputy director of the Department of Maternal and Child Health of the National Health Commission, said, since the central authority stated that local special funds can be dynamically allocated, "some places put more funds into the prevention and control of infectious diseases, so the allocation of funds for the prevention and control of cervical cancer and breast cancer has been affected.” (Caixin, 2019)
