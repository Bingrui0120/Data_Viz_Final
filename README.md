## Every year, a large number of women die of cervical cancer.

Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancies worldwide. In 2018, it ranked second in incidence and third in mortality worldwide, 570,000 women worldwide were still diagnosed with cervical cancer, and 310,000 women died of cervical cancer. About 85% of new cases and 90% of deaths occurred in underdeveloped areas (FIGO, 2018). In low- and middle-income countries, the incidence of cervical cancer is almost twice that of high-income countries, and the mortality rate is three times that of high-income countries.

In developed countries, due to the widespread use of Pap smear testing, the overall incidence of cervical cancer has been declining. However, in the past two decades, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China have been on the rise, especially among young women. Since 2002, China has ranked first in the world in the number of deaths from cervical cancer (Li, 2017). According to data from the National Cancer Center, a total of 75,500 people were newly diagnosed in China in 2016, and about 38,400 women died of cervical cancer. According to the China Health Statistics Yearbook, the mortality rate of women from cervical cancer increases with age. Among them, women aged 30-49 in urban areas and women aged 30-59 in rural areas accounted for the highest proportion of deaths from malignant tumors in women of the same age group.

The chart below shows the number of deaths from cervical cancer in all countries in the world in the past two decades. Among them, the blue line represents China, the orange line represents developed countries, and the gray line represents other countries. On the Dashboard, users can choose to view China, developed countries or other countries. Position the mouse on each line and Tableau will display the year, country and absolute value of the data.

#### Number of Female Death Due to Cervical Cancer World Wide

The chart below shows the number of deaths due to cervical cancer per 100,000 in all countries in the world over the past two decades. It can be seen that although China's value is in the middle position compared with other countries in the world, the number of female died due to cervical cancer in recent years is still larger than that of developed countries. Most of the countries with higher numbers in the figure come from African countries. In Africa, most people are still in extreme poverty. Therefore, the average number of women giving birth to children is much higher than that of other countries in the world, and the proportion of households using contraceptive measures is also lower than other countries. A number of studies have confirmed that the use of contraceptive measures, the number of births, the age of first sexual intercourse, and the number of sexual partners are all related to cervical cancer. Therefore, it is normal that the incidence of cervical cancer in African countries is higher than that in developed countries and China.

China has invested a lot of money in recent years to solve extreme poverty. China's per capita GDP increases, and the people's living standards have continued to grow. In addition, the Chinese government initiated a free cervical and breast cancer screening program for women in 2008. However, the number of female deaths from cervical cancer in China has not declined, and even tends to increase year by year.

## Cervical cancer is a preventable cancer.

Almost 100% of cervical cancers are caused by infection with a high-risk type of human HPV. Cervical cancer is currently the only malignant tumor with a clear cause and fully effective tertiary prevention methods, according to the WHO. The two main methods to control the onset of cervical cancer are through HPV vaccine and screening for precancerous lesions (FIGO, 2018). Since the advent of the HPV vaccine in 2006, a total of 107 countries around the world have officially included the HPV vaccine in their national immunization plans (WHO, 2020). Because of HPV vaccination and cancer screening, the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries has dropped significantly in the past two to three decades. From 1975 to 2010, the incidence of cervical cancer in US female was reduced by half. From 2000 to 2015, the death toll from cervical cancer per 100,000 people also dropped from 2.8 to 2.3 per year (Curry, 2018).

The figure below compares the number of people who died of cervical cancer per 100,000 people in 1990 and 2015. It can be seen that in the past 15 years, the number of deaths from cervical cancer in developed countries has decreased. The United States fell from 3.96 to 2.98, and the United Kingdom fell from 6.44 to 3.06. However, China only dropped from 6.96 to 4.78, and its proportion is much higher than that of the United States in 1990. Therefore, the problem of cervical cancer in China brooks no delay.
